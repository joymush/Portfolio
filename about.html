        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm 19 yrs old,currently<em>a software development student(prep).</em></p>
        <p>I basically don't have any experience yet except for the industrial attachment, but i took a diploma course
            in;<strong>Information Communication Technology at Kiriri Women's University and graduated in August 
            2020. </strong>
        </p>
        <p>I took a class in programming because when i did IT i actually thought
            I would be able to learn alot of languages but instead what i managed to cover
            was just HTML and C++ and i felt like i hadn't achieved what i really wanted.
        </p>
